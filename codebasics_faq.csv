What does BGP stand for?,BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol.
What is the primary function of BGP?,BGP is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.
What is an Autonomous System (AS)?,"An Autonomous System (AS) is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of one or more entities that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet."
What is an AS number (ASN)?,"An ASN is a unique number assigned to each AS, used by BGP to identify individual networks on the Internet."
What are the two types of ASNs?,"Public ASNs (globally unique) and Private ASNs (for internal use, not routed on the Internet)."
What is the range for Private ASNs?,"64512 to 65535 for 16-bit ASNs, and 4200000000 to 4294967295 for 32-bit ASNs."

What is MPLS BGP VPN?,A technology where BGP is used to exchange VPN routing information (VPNv4 routes) between Provider Edge (PE) routers over an MPLS core network.
What are BGP extended communities?,"An extension to standard communities, offering more bits (64-bit) for more complex policy tagging and transitive properties across AS boundaries."
What is BGP loop detection based on?,"The AS_PATH attribute. If a BGP router receives an update with its own ASN in the AS_PATH, it discards the route to prevent a loop."

What does 'stuck in active' mean in BGP?,"A BGP state where a router is continuously attempting to establish a session with a peer but failing, often due to network reachability issues or incorrect peering configuration."
What is the role of an IGP when running iBGP?,"An IGP ensures IP reachability between iBGP peers, which do not need to be directly connected."
Can BGP be used for internal routing within a single AS?,"Yes, iBGP is used for internal routing, but it's typically combined with an IGP that handles the actual forwarding path."
What is the difference between `next-hop-self` and `allowas-in`?,"`next-hop-self` manipulates the next-hop attribute for iBGP. `allowas-in` allows a router to accept routes that contain its own ASN in the AS_PATH, typically for specific scenarios like multi-homed customers."
What is BGP route poisoning?,A method where a router advertises a route with an unreachable metric or removes it from its BGP table to indicate that the route is no longer valid.
What does OSPF stand for?,OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First.
Is OSPF an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) or an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)?,OSPF is an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol).

In which OSPF state do neighbors become 'full' and exchange routing information?,Full state.
What is the function of the Designated Router (DR) in an OSPF multi-access network?,The DR is responsible for originating LSAs on behalf of the segment and maintaining the adjacency with all other routers on that segment.
What is the function of the Backup Designated Router (BDR) in an OSPF multi-access network?,The BDR monitors the DR and takes over its role if the DR fails.
Why are DR/BDR elected in multi-access networks?,"To reduce the number of adjacencies and LSA exchanges, optimizing efficiency."

What is a Stub Area in OSPF?,A stub area does not allow Type 5 LSAs (external routes) and injects a default route for external destinations. It's connected to Area 0 by an ABR.
What is a Totally Stubby Area in OSPF?,"A totally stubby area does not allow Type 4 or Type 5 LSAs, and converts all inter-area (Type 3) and external (Type 5) routes into a default route (0.0.0.0/0)."

What is OSPF route summarization?,"Consolidating multiple specific routes into a single, broader route advertisement to reduce routing table size."
Where can route summarization be performed in OSPF?,At ABRs (for inter-area routes - Type 3 LSAs) and ASBRs (for external routes - Type 5 LSAs).
What is the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm?,"Also known as Dijkstra's algorithm, it calculates the shortest path to all destinations from a specific router, building the SPF tree."

What is the `network` command in OSPF configuration used for?,To specify which interfaces participate in OSPF and which networks are advertised.
What is the concept of a 'stub router' in OSPF?,A router that is only connected to one other router (like a leaf node) and typically advertises a default route to its neighbor.
What is the difference between `router ospf process-id` and `router-id` command?,`process-id` is a local arbitrary number for the OSPF process. `router-id` is the unique 32-bit identifier for the router in the OSPF domain.
What is `max-metric router-lsa` (or `max-metric summary-lsa`) in OSPF?,"A command to set the router's self-originated LSA (or summary LSAs) to an infinite metric, causing other routers to avoid routing traffic through it (e.g., during maintenance)."

What is the purpose of the `area range` command in OSPF?,Used on ABRs to summarize a range of routes from a non-backbone area before advertising them into the backbone area.
What is `ip ospf priority` used for?,To influence DR/BDR election on multi-access networks. Higher priority is preferred.
What is a common reason for `DR/BDR election` failure?,All routers having an OSPF priority of 0 (making them ineligible) or mismatched network types.
What is the maximum number of areas recommended for an OSPF domain?,"It depends on network size and complexity, but generally keeping the number of areas manageable (e.g., tens to hundreds) is good practice."
What happens if an OSPF area is not connected to Area 0?,"It becomes an isolated area, and routers in that area cannot reach destinations in other areas or the Internet unless a virtual link is configured."
What is a 'stub router' in OSPF?,A router that is only connected to one other router (like a leaf node) and typically advertises a default route to its neighbor.
What is the maximum number of links per OSPF router supported?,"Varies by router model and memory, but can be hundreds or thousands of links."
What is the difference between `clear ip ospf process` and `clear ip ospf neighbor`?,`clear ip ospf process` restarts the entire OSPF process on the router. `clear ip ospf neighbor` only resets the adjacency with specific neighbors.
What is the significance of the `dead interval` in OSPF Hello packets?,It's the time a router will wait for a Hello packet from a neighbor before declaring the neighbor down.

What is the default IS-IS metric value?,The default metric for an interface is typically 10 (on Cisco devices) or similar small integer.
What are the two main levels in IS-IS hierarchy?,Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2).
What is a Level 1 (L1) router in IS-IS?,An L1 router exchanges routing information only within its own IS-IS area.
What is a Level 2 (L2) router in IS-IS?,An L2 router exchanges routing information between IS-IS areas and potentially with external networks (like the internet).
