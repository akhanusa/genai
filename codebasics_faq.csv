What is the role of an IGP when running iBGP?,"An IGP ensures IP reachability between iBGP peers, which do not need to be directly connected."
Can BGP be used for internal routing within a single AS?,"Yes, iBGP is used for internal routing, but it's typically combined with an IGP that handles the actual forwarding path."
What is the difference between `next-hop-self` and `allowas-in`?,"`next-hop-self` manipulates the next-hop attribute for iBGP. `allowas-in` allows a router to accept routes that contain its own ASN in the AS_PATH, typically for specific scenarios like multi-homed customers."
What is BGP route poisoning?,A method where a router advertises a route with an unreachable metric or removes it from its BGP table to indicate that the route is no longer valid.

How many usable host IP addresses are there in a /24 subnet?,254 (2^8 - 2).
Why do you subtract 2 from the total number of addresses in a subnet for usable hosts?,"One address is reserved for the network address, and one for the broadcast address."
What is the network address of a subnet?,"The first address in the subnet's range, where all host bits are zero."
What is the broadcast address of a subnet?,"The last address in the subnet's range, where all host bits are one."

What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?,A protocol used to resolve an IP address to a MAC address (Layer 2 physical address) within the same local network.
Why is ARP necessary for IPv4?,"Because IP addresses operate at Layer 3, but data frames at Layer 2 need MAC addresses for actual delivery on a local segment."
What are the two main methods for assigning IPv4 addresses to devices?,Static IP assignment and Dynamic IP assignment (via DHCP).
What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?,A network protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices connected to a network.

What is the difference between direct and indirect delivery in IPv4 routing?,"Direct delivery means the destination host is on the same local network. Indirect delivery means the destination is on a remote network, requiring a router."
What is a routing table?,"A table stored on a router or host that contains information about network destinations and how to reach them (next-hop, interface)."
What is the `ping` command used for in IPv4?,To test IP connectivity to a remote host and measure round-trip time.
What is the `traceroute` (or `tracert`) command used for in IPv4?,"To trace the path that an IP packet takes to reach a destination, identifying routers along the way."
How does `traceroute` work using TTL?,It sends packets with increasing TTL values and uses ICMP Time Exceeded messages to identify each hop.
